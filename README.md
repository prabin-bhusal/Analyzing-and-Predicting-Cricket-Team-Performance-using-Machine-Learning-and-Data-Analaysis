# Cricket Player Performance Prediction

This project analyzes cricket player performance data collected from ESPNcricinfo between 2015 and 2023. The analysis includes regression metrics computed using Logistic Regression, Neural Network, and Random Forest Regressor models for predicting cricket scores.

## Key Features

- Utilization of regression models for prediction and evaluation of cricket player performance.
- Calculation of feature scores to determine the importance of various performance metrics.
- Comparison of feature rankings for specific players (e.g., V Kohli, HH Pandya).
- Correlation analysis between different performance metrics and their impact on players' records.
- Cross-validation of models and comparison of predictions for V Kohli and HH Pandya's records.

## Insights and Findings

- Identified significant features influencing players' performance.
- Highlighted differences in feature importance between players, showcasing unique playing styles.
- Correlation analysis revealed associations between specific metrics and total runs scored.
- Model comparison indicated the Logistic Regression model as the top performer for predicting V Kohli's records.
